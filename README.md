## Project Overview
> This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game.  
The goal is to create an Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice. To build this project, you can follow along with the practice set and customize the Court Counter app to track scores from a different sport.

## Suggested App Ideas
- Baseball Scores App: Track both runs and outs
- American Football Scores App: Add a button for each of the 4 amounts of points a team can score in american football.
- Football Scores app: Track both points and fouls

## Requirements
- Adding button code to your app
